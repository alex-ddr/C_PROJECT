This project was done by Alexandre Didier and Samuel Weistroffer. 

To use the program you have just to double click on "project_C.exe" (the shortcut or in the file "cmake-build-debug" you have the original one) and use the compiler you prefer.

If you use Windows, you can also follow those steps :
	- tap the windows key, then "cmd", then press enter
	- write "cd [the path of your folder]\project_C\cmake-build-debug", then press enter
	- write "start project_C.exe", then press enter

Then you can type "help" and press enter to get all the command you can use.
